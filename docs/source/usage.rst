Using the app
=============

Launching
*********

The easy way
------------

Launch (double click) the ``launch_app.bat`` command file.

What it does: It will launch the main python script in the Conda environment we just created

The advanced way
----------------

Launch the ``main.py`` file using a python IDE (PyCharm or equivalent) and the chubacapp python environment (for debugging).

Preprocessing
*************

Prepare the dives for preprocessing with Matisse Preprocessing. It:

-	Groups multiple navigation dim2 files
-	Correct them using the .txt reference navigation file (optional)
-	Copy the image (optional)

The newly created file is stored in the output directory, along with (eventual) images.

If the input directory consists in multiple acquisition directories, all navigation files from each of them are concatenated.



Removing blur
*************

Detection and removal of blurry images, and removal from the *.dim2 nav file. It uses the variance of the Laplacian to get the amount of blur of images, and then filter them using student t test. Itâ€™s based on Adrian Rosebrock fast Fourier transform algorithm (link needed).

First feed the image directory, and then launch. The algorithm will evaluate a blur value for each image and store it in a csv file. This can take a while.

Then the user can choose the alpha level to eliminate the blurriest images. The deleted images will be transferred to a bin directory.

If le blur evaluation phase has already been done, you can provide the csv to skip the (heavy) calculation step.

Annotation conversion
*********************

This allows to convert annotations on 2D images to georeferenced 2D annotations or georeferenced 3D annotations. These annotations can be objects annotations or image labels. The annotation report file is a *.csv coming from Biigle. Please make sure to select the correct mode (annotation/label).

Geolocalisation
---------------


The 2D algorithm converts Biigle annotations to 2D annotations using corresponding geotiff from Matisse3D software. It uses features matching to get a homographic matrix, then use it to convert annotations coordinates. It has proven to be less precise than 3D reprojection.


Reprojection
------------

The 3D algorithm reprojects annotations from a Biigle csv export file on a 3D (*.ply) model. It uses the camera position extracted from the sfm_data file obtained during the photogrammetric reconstruction. It can be exported as a shapefile (lose of the 3D information) or using the 3DMetrics protocol.
