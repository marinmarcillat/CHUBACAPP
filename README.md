# CHUBACAPP

Usefull tools for image mosaics analysis and faunal annotation processing, as part of a complete process pipeline to treat underwater imaging transects.
A methodological paper is in preparation, and will be added here after publishing.

Documentation: [Chubacapp](https://chubacapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### New feature ! From images to video: introducing video annotations reprojection !

Along with: ability to add new cameras, and a more optimized reprojection

Coming soon: updated documentation, video annotation post-processing, multiprocessing and parallelization for faster reprojection, and more !
