Welcome ! Chubacapp is a toolbox to process images, 3D models and annotation data from ROV and AUV.

Main features:
- Annotation reprojection on 3D models to get precisely geolocated 3D annotations 
- 3D annotation viewer
- YoloV5 inference and export to Biigle via API
- Disjoint image selection using 3D model and image imprint reprojection
- 3D topographic metrics calculation from 3D models

It contains usefull tools for image mosaics analysis and faunal annotation processing, as part of a complete process pipeline to treat underwater imaging transects.
A methodological paper is in preparation, and will be added here after publishing.
